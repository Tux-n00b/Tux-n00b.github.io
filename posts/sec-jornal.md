# These are the fundamentals I need to understand in order to become the hacker I imagine myself to be:
1. Computer Science principles.
2. Hardware Interaction.
3. Operating systems.
4. Advanced Windows.
5. Exploitation Techniques.


# For pen testing This is a short guide/ roadmap.
    1. Basics
	    * -Learn cybersecurity Fundamentals.
	    * -Learn python and C
	    * -Learn Linux
    2. Understand basic web/ infrastructure pen testing, finish portswigger and spam CTFs on hackthebox - your main resource (use writeups when you are stuck)
	    * -Get good at documenting (writeups and reports)
	    * -Learn somthing new in the realm you choose 	 	 every F time.
    3. Get good -> try to land an entry job and learn more from there (they will make you learn new technologies)


# Languages to learn;
	* C
	* python
	* SQL
	* Bash

# 🔁 When Reading Writeups Feels Like Cheating (Or “Just Copying”)

You’re not wrong — reading a writeup *before* solving a challenge **can feel like skipping the learning**, especially if you just copy the steps. But it doesn’t have to be.

It all comes down to **how you use the writeup**.

---

## 🧠 You’re Not Cheating — You’re Studying

### ❌ What *feels* like copying:
- Reading the full solution and following each command *without understanding why*  
- Finishing the box, deleting it, and forgetting what you did

### ✅ What *is actually* learning:
- Reading just enough to get **unstuck**, then trying again *on your own*  
- Using the writeup as a **study guide**, not an answer sheet  
- Pausing to ask: *“Why did they do that? What tool is that? Can I replicate it from memory later?”*

---

## 🔄 Better Workflow for Using Writeups

### 🧪 Step 1: Try the Box or CTF *Completely Blind*
- Recon, enumerate, poke around  
- Take notes: your thoughts, guesses, blockers

### 🧠 Step 2: When You Get Stuck → Read a Hint or Section
- Don’t read the full writeup yet  
- Just enough to spark a new idea or tool to try

### 🛠 Step 3: Try Again with That New Insight
- Don’t copy-paste — understand *why* it works  
- Try adapting or re-implementing it on your own

### 📓 Step 4: After Finishing, Read the Full Writeup
- Fill in gaps, compare your approach  
- Rebuild the exploit from memory next week

### ✍️ Step 5: Summarize It Yourself
- In your own words — in a journal or GitHub writeup  
- Bonus: try automating it or adding it to a checklist

> 🧠 “Copying” becomes learning when you **engage with it**, **rebuild it**, and **reflect on it**.

---

## 🔍 Why This Works

You’re not training to be a CTF robot — you’re becoming a **problem solver**.  
And in real-world bug hunting or pentesting:

- You Google things constantly  
- You reference past writeups and CVEs  
- You read docs and adapt attacks

So reading a writeup is **practicing the research process**, which is 80% of real-world hacking.

---

## 🧾 What is WAHH?

**WAHH** = *The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook*  
A highly respected book for learning **web exploitation** techniques (like XSS, SQLi, IDOR, etc).  
You’re on Chapter 3 — that’s already solid progress!

---

## 🧭 Final Thoughts: You're Doing It Right — Go Deeper

You're not cheating. You're learning.

✅ Read the writeups  
✅ Get stuck  
✅ Come back smarter  
✅ Take notes  
✅ Rebuild from memory  
✅ Explain it to someone else

That’s not copying —  
That’s **becoming**.
